Write code for obtaining CAM data and recoginising target and obstacles
using custom vision or image processing.

 a) How to detect custom objects?
 -> Discovered that tensor flow will be helpful. i.e :- We need to take 
several pics of object to be detected, label data and keep it in google 
cloud, use this (https://goo.gle/3ocbqmI) code to train an ML model, and 
in the same code, the model is built as a .tflite file.
This file needs to be transferred to the MC for object detection.
 
 b) Need to figure out how to connect laptop with MC for code transferring.
 -> Using Arduino - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KIpFIbRMk
    Need to Retry (Should work)
 -> Using Serial Transfer Module - 
    https://randomnerdtutorials.com/program-upload-code-esp32-cam/
    Tried and tested
 -> Note: Keep holding the reset button as code compiles to around 75 % 
    and let go of it only when you see the "connecting..."

 c) Need to figure out which IDE to use to code.
 -> Arduino IDE with ESP extension works so far.

 d) Need to figure out how to run .tflite on MC (library installation).

 e) Need to figure out how to provide input (cam data) and obtain output
(boolean) from the tf file in MC.
